## 📌 About the Project

The collage is a space where **everyone in accessibility can know everyone**. Each square represents someone building accessible tools, advocating for equity, challenging barriers, or supporting disability inclusion in their own way.

✨ It’s not about celebrating disability — it’s about recognizing the work, connection, and purpose within the community.

## ♿ Accessibility Commitment

As a strong advocate for inclusive technology, I’ve worked to make the collage experience accessible.  
That includes:

- Keyboard-only navigation  
- Semantic structure  
- Descriptive alt text for every image  
- Screen reader testing with NVDA  

> I'm still learning and open to feedback — if you encounter any accessibility issues, please feel free to reach out.
